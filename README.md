# ElementalsCard
Hello guys! This is a project I've been working on for about a few weeks(like in my spare time)
Its just a little card game, so far I've had a lot of fun thinking about the different methods I'd need in a card game
I.e. one interesting problem I've found is the following:
How my card game works is basically a bunch of "card holder" surfaces exist and when a card is drawn from the deck it is directly blitted onto these card surface objects
However, if you play a card the rules of the game say you have to draw a card too
But assuming you have a hand of 7 cards, and one card is missing, how do I arrange the cards so that the newest card is at the last position(not the position of
the card that was played)

Well, right now I'm making the method for that(well I already have it, its just on a different iteration of this same project which I broke LOL and I am too lazy to fix
because the code isn't modular at all so it would take forever) Im in the process of transfering it over.

Also, this code looks a lot cleaner, its modular, and I can actually look at it without wanting to kill myself. If anyone actually reads these(which I know no one
ever will) feel free to ask me any questions you may have or if your a begginer(why can't I spell) and need help figuring out how to create these methods.
